The purpose of this is to display how threads work by using the dart method.
Only 2 files are needed to run this program: Program.cs and FindPiThread.cs
The program is run simply by pressing the Start button at top of the screen.
The biggest challenge I encountered was in the FindPiThread.cs file with the ThrowDarts function.
If I had more time I would attempt the extra credit.
